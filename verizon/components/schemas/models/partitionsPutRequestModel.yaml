  minPasswordComplexity:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The minimum level of complexity that all passwords used in this Partition must have.
      There are four complexity 'factors' that can be evaluated. These are the presence
      of the following character types in the password: lowercase characters, uppercase
      characters, integers, and special characters. For instance, the password '123a'
      would get a complexity rating of '2', since it contains integers and lowercase characters.
