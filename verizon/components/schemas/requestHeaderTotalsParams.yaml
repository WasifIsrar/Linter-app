description: >
  To configure a request to return a total for all instances of a field in a result set, 
  use the totals header in the format `totals={operator}[]={key}`. 
  This will calculate the desired total and return it in the `details > totals` object of the response. 
  For instance, if you want to sum the `total` field of all transactions, 
  you would use the `sum` operator. The response will include the result set, 
  along with the calculated total in the `details` section. See [Collection Operators](page:welcome#collection-operators) for detailed information and examples on how to use totals header.
