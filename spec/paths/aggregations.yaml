      \ the operators 'equals', 'greater', 'less', 'like', 'in' and 'sort'. To sort\
      \ the resources, use the keywords 'asc' (for an ascending sort) or 'desc' (for\
      \ a descending sort).\nYou may also use explicit 'and/or' querying by passing\
      \ arrays of or and arrays of and parameters. For example, to find all resources\
      \ that have a property of 'public' set to '1' or a property of 'active' set\
      \ to '0', set this header to 'or[][public][equals]=1&or[][active][equals]=0'."
